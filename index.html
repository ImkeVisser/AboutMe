                <p>Once I had finished high school, I enrolled at Utrecht University for my Bachelors degree, before moving on to the University of Amsterdam to obtain my Masters Degree in Social Sciences. 
                    With great pleasure I did research into (criminal) behaviour of youths. The skills I've mastered doing research have in my opinion much in common with those required to become a developer.</p>
